## Problem

Find the largest real number $a$ and the smallest real number $b$ such that
\[
a\,x(\pi - x) \le \sin x \le b\,x(\pi - x)
\]
for all $x$ in the interval $[0,\pi]$.

## Submission

To find the constants $a$ and $b$ such that
\[
a\,x(\pi - x) \le \sin x \le b\,x(\pi - x)
\]
for all $x \in [0, \pi]$, we can rewrite the inequality for $x \in (0, \pi)$ as:
\[
a \le \frac{\sin x}{x(\pi - x)} \le b
\]
Let $f(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x(\pi - x)}$. We need to find the infimum and supremum of $f(x)$ on $(0, \pi)$.
First, observe the symmetry $f(\pi - x) = \frac{\sin(\pi - x)}{(\pi - x)(\pi - (\pi - x))} = \frac{\sin x}{(\pi - x)x} = f(x)$. Thus, $f(x)$ is symmetric about $x = \pi/2$, and we can restrict our analysis to the interval $(0, \pi/2]$.

We calculate the values at the boundaries of this interval:
1. Limit as $x \to 0$:
\[
\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{\pi - x} = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\pi}
\]
2. Value at $x = \pi/2$:
\[
f(\pi/2) = \frac{\sin(\pi/2)}{(\pi/2)(\pi - \pi/2)} = \frac{1}{(\pi/2)^2} = \frac{4}{\pi^2}
\]
Comparing the values, $\frac{1}{\pi} \approx 0.318$ and $\frac{4}{\pi^2} \approx 0.405$. So $f(\pi/2) > \lim_{x \to 0} f(x)$.

To determine the behavior of $f(x)$ between these points, we examine the derivative $f'(x)$.
\[
f'(x) = \frac{(\pi x - x^2) \cos x - (\pi - 2x) \sin x}{(\pi x - x^2)^2}
\]
Let $p(x) = (\pi x - x^2) \cos x - (\pi - 2x) \sin x$.
We find $p'(x) = (x^2 - \pi x + 2) \sin x$.
The quadratic term $q(x) = x^2 - \pi x + 2$ has roots at $\frac{\pi \pm \sqrt{\pi^2 - 8}}{2} \approx \frac{3.14 \pm 1.37}{2}$, which are approximately $0.89$ and $2.25$.
For $x \in (0, 0.89)$, $q(x) > 0$, so $p'(x) > 0$.
For $x \in (0.89, \pi/2 \approx 1.57)$, $q(x) < 0$, so $p'(x) < 0$.
Since $p(0) = 0$ and $p(\pi/2) = 0$, $p(x)$ increases from 0 to a positive maximum and then decreases back to 0. Thus $p(x) > 0$ for all $x \in (0, \pi/2)$.
Since $p(x) > 0$, $f'(x) > 0$ on $(0, \pi/2)$, which means $f(x)$ is strictly increasing on $(0, \pi/2]$.

Therefore:
\[
\inf_{x \in (0, \pi)} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi}
\]
\[
\sup_{x \in (0, \pi)} f(x) = f(\pi/2) = \frac{4}{\pi^2}
\]
To satisfy the inequalities for all $x$, we must have $a \le \inf f(x)$ and $b \ge \sup f(x)$. The largest such $a$ is $1/\pi$ and the smallest such $b$ is $4/\pi^2$.

Calculations at endpoints $x=0$ and $x=\pi$ yield $0 \le 0 \le 0$, consistent with any finite $a, b$.

Thus,
\[
a = \frac{1}{\pi}, \quad b = \frac{4}{\pi^2}
\]
