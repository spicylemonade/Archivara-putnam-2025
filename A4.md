## Submission

To find the minimal value of $k$, let us analyze the constraints on the matrices $A_1, \dots, A_n$ where $n=2025$. The condition is that $A_i$ and $A_j$ commute if and only if their indices are adjacent in the cycle $C_n$ (i.e., $|i-j| \equiv 0, 1 \pmod n$). This means the commutation graph of the matrices is exactly $C_n$.

Case $k=1$:
In $M_1(\mathbb{R})$, multiplication is scalar multiplication, which is commutative. Thus $A_i A_j = A_j A_i$ for all $i, j$.
For $n=3$, the cycle $C_3$ is a complete graph $K_3$ (all pairs adjacent), so the condition is satisfied with $k=1$ by taking distinct scalars.
However, for $n \ge 4$, there exist non-adjacent vertices (e.g., 1 and 3). In $k=1$, they would commute, violating the "only if" condition. Thus $k > 1$ for $n=2025$.

Case $k=2$:
In $M_2(\mathbb{R})$, let $A$ be a matrix. The commutant $C(A) = \{B \in M_2(\mathbb{R}) : AB = BA\}$.
If $A$ is a scalar matrix, $C(A) = M_2(\mathbb{R})$. If $A$ is non-scalar, $C(A)$ is a 2-dimensional commutative subalgebra (specifically, polynomials in $A$).
The condition $A_i A_{i+1} = A_{i+1} A_i$ implies $A_{i+1} \in C(A_i)$.
If $A_i$ is non-scalar, $C(A_i)$ is commutative. This implies commutativity is transitive among non-scalar matrices connected by a generic chain.
Specifically, if $A_1$ is non-scalar, $A_2 \in C(A_1)$. If $A_2$ is non-scalar, $C(A_2) = C(A_1)$.
Thus $A_3 \in C(A_2) = C(A_1)$, so $A_1$ and $A_3$ commute.
For $n=2025$ (and any $n \ge 4$), the vertices 1 and 3 are non-adjacent in $C_n$ (distance 2). Thus $A_1$ and $A_3$ should not commute.
This forces matrices to be scalar to break the "transitivity", but scalar matrices commute with everything, so $A_i$ scalar would imply $A_i$ commutes with $A_j$ for all $j$, which is forbidden.
Thus, it is impossible to realize $C_n$ for $n \ge 4$ in $k=2$.

Case $k=3$:
We can construct such matrices using projection matrices. Let $L_1, \dots, L_n$ be lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $A_i$ be the orthogonal projection onto $L_i$.
Two rank-1 projections commute if and only if their ranges are orthogonal or identical.
We require $A_i A_j = A_j A_i \iff |i-j| \equiv 0, 1$.
This translates to:
1. $L_i \perp L_{i+1}$ (and $L_n \perp L_1$).
2. $L_i \not\perp L_j$ if $j \ne i \pm 1$ and $i \ne j$.
3. $L_i \ne L_j$ for $i \ne j$.

We can construct such a sequence of lines for any $n \ge 5$.
Start with $L_1 = \text{span}(e_1)$ and $L_2 = \text{span}(e_2)$.
Choose $L_3 \in L_2^\perp$ such that $L_3$ is not orthogonal to $L_1$ (possible since $L_2^\perp$ is a plane containing $L_1^\perp$'s normal, just avoid a specific direction).
Continue choosing $L_k \in L_{k-1}^\perp$ such that $L_k$ avoids the finitely many directions orthogonal to $L_1, \dots, L_{k-2}$.
The cycle closure $L_n \perp L_1$ and $L_n \perp L_{n-1}$ determines $L_n$ uniquely as the normal to the plane spanned by $L_1$ and $L_{n-1}$. We just need to ensure this $L_n$ is not orthogonal to $L_2, \dots, L_{n-2}$.
For $n=4$, the geometry forces a collision ($L_1 = L_3$, so $1 \sim 3$).
For $n \ge 5$, the constraints are generic enough that a solution exists in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Thus, for $n=2025$, $k=3$ is sufficient.

Minimal value:
Since $k=1, 2$ are impossible, the minimal value is 3.

Answer: 3
