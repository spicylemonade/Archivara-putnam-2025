## Problem

Suppose that each point in the plane is colored either red or green, subject to the following condition:

For every three noncollinear points $A,B,C$ of the same color, the center of the circle passing through $A,B,C$ is also this color.

Prove that all points of the plane are the same color.

## Submission

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist both red and green points in the plane. Let $R$ be the set of red points and $G$ be the set of green points. We are given that for any three noncollinear points of the same color, their circumcenter is also that color.

First, we establish the following property:
**Lemma:** If $P$ is a red point, then any circle centered at $P$ contains at most 2 green points.
**Proof:** Suppose a circle $C$ centered at $P$ contains at least 3 distinct green points, say $A, B, C$. Since they lie on a circle, they are noncollinear. By the problem statement, the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$ must be green. The circumcenter of points on circle $C$ is the center of $C$, which is $P$. Thus, $P$ must be green. However, we assumed $P$ is red. This is a contradiction. Therefore, circle $C$ can contain at most 2 green points.

By symmetry, if $Q$ is a green point, any circle centered at $Q$ contains at most 2 red points.

Now, let $P$ be a red point and $Q$ be a green point. Such points exist by our assumption.
Consider two distinct positive radii $r_1$ and $r_2$. Let $\Gamma_1$ be the circle centered at $Q$ with radius $r_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ be the circle centered at $Q$ with radius $r_2$.
Since $Q$ is green, each of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ contains at most 2 red points. Let $E_1 = \Gamma_1 \cap R$ and $E_2 = \Gamma_2 \cap R$. The sets $E_1$ and $E_2$ are finite (size $\le 2$). All other points on these circles are green.

We wish to find a circle centered at $P$ that intersects both $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ at points that are not in $E_1 \cup E_2$.
Let $x$ be the radius of a circle centered at $P$. Let $C_P(x)$ denote this circle.
The circle $C_P(x)$ intersects $\Gamma_1$ if $x \in [|d(P,Q)-r_1|, d(P,Q)+r_1]$. It intersects $\Gamma_2$ if $x \in [|d(P,Q)-r_2|, d(P,Q)+r_2]$.
Since $P \neq Q$ (different colors), and by choosing $r_1, r_2$ appropriately (e.g., large enough or close to $d(P,Q)$), the intersection of these intervals is a non-empty interval of strictly positive length.
For any $x$ in this interval (and avoiding the boundary values corresponding to tangency), $C_P(x)$ intersects $\Gamma_1$ at exactly 2 distinct points and $\Gamma_2$ at exactly 2 distinct points. Since $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are concentric with different radii, they are disjoint, so we have 4 distinct intersection points in total.

We need to avoid the "bad" points in $E_1 \cup E_2$.
For any point $Y \in E_1 \cup E_2$, $C_P(x)$ passes through $Y$ if and only if $x = d(P, Y)$.
Since $E_1 \cup E_2$ is a finite set, there are only finitely many such "bad" radii $x$.
The set of valid radii for intersection is an interval (infinite cardinality). Thus, we can choose a radius $x$ such that $C_P(x)$ intersects $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ at points strictly within $G \cap \Gamma_1$ and $G \cap \Gamma_2$.

Let this chosen circle be $C^*$. It contains 2 green points from $\Gamma_1$ and 2 green points from $\Gamma_2$. Thus $C^*$ contains 4 distinct green points. Any 3 of these points are noncollinear (as they lie on a circle).
Let three of these points be $A', B', C'$. They are green.
Their circumcenter is the center of $C^*$, which is $P$.
According to the condition, $P$ must be green.
But $P$ is red.

This contradiction implies that our initial assumption (that both colors exist) is false.
Therefore, all points in the plane must be the same color.
