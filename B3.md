## Problem

Suppose $S$ is a nonempty set of positive integers with the property that if $n$ is in $S$, then every positive divisor of
\[
2025^{n} - 15^{n}
\]
is in $S$.

Must $S$ contain all positive integers?

## Submission

Let $S$ be a nonempty set of positive integers such that if $n \in S$, then every positive divisor of $f(n) = 2025^n - 15^n$ is in $S$. We want to determine if $S$ must contain all positive integers.

First, factor the expression:
\[ 2025^n - 15^n = (15^2)^n - 15^n = 15^{2n} - 15^n = 15^n (15^n - 1) \]
Wait, earlier I used $2025 = 15 \times 135$. Let's recheck.
$15^2 = 225$. $2025 / 15 = 135$.
So $2025 = 15 \times 135$.
Then $2025^n - 15^n = (15 \times 135)^n - 15^n = 15^n (135^n - 1)$.
The divisors of $f(n)$ are in $S$.

We proceed by induction on $k$ to show that $k \in S$ for all $k \ge 1$.
Let $k$ be the smallest positive integer such that $k \notin S$.
Since $S$ is nonempty, let $n_0 \in S$. Then $1 \mid f(n_0)$, so $1 \in S$.
Thus $k > 1$.

Case 1: $k$ is coprime to 15.
Then $\gcd(k, 15) = 1$.
Since $k$ is the smallest integer not in $S$, every positive integer $m < k$ is in $S$.
Consider the order of $135$ modulo $k$, denoted as $d_k = \text{ord}_k(135)$.
By Carmichael's theorem or Euler's theorem, $d_k \le \lambda(k) < k$ (since $k > 1$ and for $k=2$, $d_2=1<2$).
Since $d_k < k$, we have $d_k \in S$.
Since $d_k \in S$, all divisors of $f(d_k)$ are in $S$.
We have $f(d_k) = 15^{d_k} (135^{d_k} - 1)$.
By definition of order, $135^{d_k} \equiv 1 \pmod k$, so $k \mid (135^{d_k} - 1)$.
Since $\gcd(k, 15)=1$, this implies $k \mid f(d_k)$.
Thus $k \in S$, a contradiction.

Case 2: $k$ is not coprime to 15.
Write $k = 3^a 5^b m$ with $\gcd(m, 15) = 1$.
We need to find an $n \in S$ such that $k \mid f(n)$.
Note that $f(n) = 15^n (135^n - 1)$ is divisible by $3^n 5^n$.
If we choose $n \ge \max(a, b)$, then $3^a 5^b \mid 15^n \mid f(n)$.
We also need $m \mid 135^n - 1$. This requires $d_m \mid n$, where $d_m = \text{ord}_m(135)$.
We look for $n$ of the form $j \cdot d_m$ such that $n \ge \max(a, b)$.
We want to choose such an $n$ with $n < k$.
We know $d_m < m$ (if $m > 1$) or $d_m=1$ (if $m=1$).
If $m=1$, $k = 3^a 5^b$. Smallest valid $n$ is $\max(a, b)$.
Clearly $\max(a, b) < 3^a 5^b = k$ (for $k > 1$).
If $m > 1$, we need a multiple of $d_m$ at least $\max(a, b)$.
The smallest such multiple is less than $\max(a, b) + d_m$.
We check if $\max(a, b) + m < 3^a 5^b m$. This inequality holds for all integers relevant here.
Thus, there exists an integer $n < k$ such that $k \mid f(n)$.
Since $n < k$, by hypothesis $n \in S$.
Since $n \in S$, all divisors of $f(n)$ are in $S$, so $k \in S$.
Contradiction.

Thus, there is no smallest missing integer $k$. $S$ must contain all positive integers.
