# Archivara-Math

**Archivara-Math** achieved a score of **11/12 on the Putnam 2025**, missing only **Problem B6**.

- **Reason for miss:** B6 was solved too slowly and no output was produced in time.  
- **Constraints:**  
  - No internet access  
  - ~15 minutes spent per problem  

This result demonstrates strong performance across nearly the entire exam under strict time and resource constraints.
