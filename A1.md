## Problem

Let $m_0$ and $n_0$ be distinct positive integers. For every positive integer $k$, define $m_k$ and $n_k$ to be the relatively prime positive integers such that
\[
\frac{m_k}{n_k} = \frac{2m_{k-1} + 1}{2n_{k-1} + 1}.
\]

Prove that $2m_k + 1$ and $2n_k + 1$ are relatively prime for all but finitely many positive integers $k$.

Let $g_k = \gcd(2m_k + 1, 2n_k + 1)$ for any integer $k \ge 0$. Note that since $2m_k+1$ is odd, $g_k$ must be an odd integer.

The recurrence relation is given by
\[ \frac{m_k}{n_k} = \frac{2m_{k-1} + 1}{2n_{k-1} + 1}. \]
Since $m_k$ and $n_k$ are relatively prime positive integers, we must have
\[ m_k = \frac{2m_{k-1} + 1}{g_{k-1}} \quad \text{and} \quad n_k = \frac{2n_{k-1} + 1}{g_{k-1}}. \]
Let $\Delta_k = n_k - m_k$. Substituting the expressions for $m_k$ and $n_k$, we get:
\[ \Delta_k = \frac{2n_{k-1} + 1}{g_{k-1}} - \frac{2m_{k-1} + 1}{g_{k-1}} = \frac{2(n_{k-1} - m_{k-1})}{g_{k-1}} = \frac{2\Delta_{k-1}}{g_{k-1}}. \]
Applying this recurrence repeatedly, we find that
\[ \Delta_k = \Delta_0 \frac{2^k}{g_0 g_1 \dots g_{k-1}}. \]
Since $m_k$ and $n_k$ are integers, $\Delta_k$ is an integer. Thus, the denominator $g_0 g_1 \dots g_{k-1}$ must divide the numerator $\Delta_0 2^k$.
Let $P_k = \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} g_i$. Then $P_k$ divides $\Delta_0 2^k$.
Since each $g_i$ is odd (as it divides $2m_i+1$), their product $P_k$ is also odd. Therefore, $\gcd(P_k, 2^k) = 1$.
Consequently, $P_k$ must divide $\Delta_0$.
Since $m_0$ and $n_0$ are distinct, $\Delta_0 = n_0 - m_0 \neq 0$. Thus $P_k$ divides a fixed non-zero integer $\Delta_0$ for all $k$.
Also, since $m_i, n_i$ are positive integers, $2m_i+1 \ge 3$, so $g_i \ge 1$ for all $i$.
The sequence $P_k$ is a sequence of positive integers such that $P_{k+1} = P_k g_k$. Since $g_k \ge 1$, the sequence is non-decreasing: $P_0 \le P_1 \le P_2 \le \dots$.
Moreover, $P_k \le |\Delta_0|$ for all $k$.
A non-decreasing sequence of integers that is bounded from above must eventually become constant.
Thus, there exists an integer $K$ such that for all $k \ge K$, $P_{k+1} = P_k$.
The condition $P_{k+1} = P_k$ implies $P_k g_k = P_k$. Since $P_k \ge 1$, we can divide by $P_k$ to get $g_k = 1$.
Therefore, $g_k = 1$ for all $k \ge K$.
By definition, $g_k = \gcd(2m_k + 1, 2n_k + 1)$.
So, $2m_k + 1$ and $2n_k + 1$ are relatively prime for all $k \ge K$, which means they are relatively prime for all but finitely many positive integers $k$.
